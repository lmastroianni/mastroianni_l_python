### Pick your weapon and play against ther computer- you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory-<code>cd directory name</code>- and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for mac/linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

2. Scissors cuts paper
3. Rock smashes scissors

*Choose your weapon wisely!*

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.


The first to reach 3 wins- wins the match! Goodluck!
